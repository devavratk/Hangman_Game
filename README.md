Hangman game is used for childrens to help them understand words spellings

We take a random word as our secret word of some length from words.txt file

Then we give users option of choosing a letter.
Then computer will tell the user whether the word is in the secret word
We will place it on its appropriate position in word and show user how many
attempts he has and the word he created so far.
Each correct guess will not reduce the number of attempts left.

For each wrong guess, a penalty will be given by reducing number of chances.
