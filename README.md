Hangman
-
This is a vert fun game, majorly used by children to help them learn spellings of words</br>
Steps -</br>
We pick a random word from words.txt file as the secret word for the game. Players are shown the length of characters present in secret word. They will have specific number of chances for guessing letters in the word.
On every guess, program will tell the player whether the character is in the secret word or not. if yes, we place it on its appropriate blank position and show players how many attempts they have left and the word they created so far.</br>
For each wrong guess, a penalty will be given by reducing number of chances (In java implementation, a hangman is drawn on the screen with its condition to be hanged).</br></br>
Codes are performed in Java(new implementation) as well as in Python(old implementation).
